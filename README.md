# What-are-the-early-positive-signs-after-embryo-transfer-to-watch-for-

After embryo transfer many patients endure the “two-week wait.” Some early signs can appear but are not definitive: light cramping or twinges (possible implantation), mild spotting or implantation bleeding, breast tenderness, fatigue, bloating, and heightened sense of smell or mood changes (often due to progesterone and hormones). Remember these symptoms overlap with medication effects and pre-period signs. Severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever, or anything alarming should prompt contact with your clinic. The only reliable confirmation is biochemical (blood hCG) and then ultrasound for fetal heartbeat. Emotional support and avoiding excessive self-testing or early home tests can reduce stress during the wait. For personalised advice on testing timing and symptom interpretation, follow your clinic’s protocol.
